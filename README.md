# laBiblioteca
Mobile app built in Ionic2, Angular2, and Typescript. 

Utilizes Spotify and MovieDb data from laBibliotecaPubSubWebServer.

Flow of laBiblioteca:

1) Data Provider pulls records from MovieDb and Spotify APIs every 4 seconds.

2) Data provider pushes json to laBiblioteca's web server via POST in Express.

3) On POST, Express middleware saves records to Redis db, trims records in Redis to most recent 10, and then pushes the latest records to a websocket hosted by laBiblioteca API.

4) LaBiblioteca client subscribes to observable from its respective movie or music websocket.

5) Ionic 2 displays streaming data, unshifting the latest record to top of display.
